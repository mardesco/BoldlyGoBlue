== Description ==

A bold blue WordPress theme, excellent for a business or professional website.  Its continuing mission, to boldly go where no blue has gone before!  "Boldly Go Blue" is a child theme by Jesse Smith of [Mardesco] (http://www.mardesco.com/).  It requires the parent theme, [Stargazer] (http://wordpress.org/themes/stargazer) by Justin Tadlock.

Pinstripes aren't your thing? It's easy to remove them and show off the tasteful baby-blue solid background color.  The theme package also includes several alternate stripe background images you can select if you prefer them.

== Installation ==

1. Install the parent theme, "Stargazer," from the WordPress repository.  You can use the "browse themes" auto-installer in your site's wp-admin, or you can upload the theme manually to your '/wp-content/themes' directory.  
2. Install the "Boldly Go Blue" child theme to your 'wp-content/themes/' directory in the same manner.  
3. Activate "Boldly Go Blue" using the link provided.
4. Don't forget to set up your navigation menus.
5. Have fun!
